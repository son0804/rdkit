    <b>Experimental:</b> This function is experimental. The API or results may change from
    release to release.
    
    \param mol:          the molecule to be fingerprinted
    \param layers:       the layers to be included (see below)
    \param minPath:      the minimum path length (in bonds) to be included
    \param maxPath:      the minimum path length (in bonds) to be included
    \param fpSize:       the size of the fingerprint
    \param tgtDensity:   if the generated fingerprint is below this density, it will
                         be folded until the density is reached.
    \param minSize:      the minimum size to which the fingerprint will be
                         folded
    \param atomCounts:   if provided, this will be used to provide the count of the number
                         of paths that set bits each atom is involved in. The vector should
                         have at least as many entries as the molecule has atoms and is not
                         zeroed out here.
    \param setOnlyBits:  if provided, only bits that are set in this bit vector will be set
                         in the result. This is essentially the same as doing:
                            (*res) &= (*setOnlyBits);
                         but also has an impact on the atomCounts (if being used)
