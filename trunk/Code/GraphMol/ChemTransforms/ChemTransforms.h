     Bonds are created between the joining atom in the existing molecule
     and the atoms in the new molecule. So, using SMILES instead of molecules:
            replaceSubstructs('OC(=O)NCCNC(=O)O','C(=O)O','[X]') ->
	          ['[X]NCCNC(=O)O','OC(=O)NCCN[X]']
            replaceSubstructs('OC(=O)NCCNC(=O)O','C(=O)O','[X]',true) ->
	          ['[X]NCCN[X]']
     Chains should be handled "correctly":
            replaceSubstructs('CC(=O)C','C(=O)','[X]') ->
	          ['C[X]C']
     As should rings:
            replaceSubstructs('C1C(=O)C1','C(=O)','[X]') ->
	          ['C1[X]C1']
     And higher order branches:
            replaceSubstructs('CC(=O)(C)C','C(=O)','[X]') ->
	          ['C[X](C)C']
     Note that the client is responsible for making sure that the
       resulting molecule actually makes sense - this function does not
       perform sanitization.

      \param mol         the ROMol of interest
      \param query       the query ROMol
      \param replacement the ROMol to be inserted
      \param replaceAll  if this is true, only a single result, with all occurances
                         of the substructure replaced, will be returned.

      \return a vector of pointers to copies of \c mol with the matching atoms
          and bonds (if any) replaced

      Note that this is essentially identical to the replaceSidechains function, except we
