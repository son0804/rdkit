Redirecting cout / cerr to a trace.

For example we use some 3rd party libraries which write errors to cout / 
cerr etc, so we allow the option of running (via a command line option) 
in console mode (anything written to std output appears), or silent 
mode, where cout / cerr is redirected to its own trace.
