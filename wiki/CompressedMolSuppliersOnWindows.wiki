#summary Building with support for compressed MolSuppliers on windows
#labels Notes,Development

In order to use the new compressed MolSupplier classes on windows, you need to install zlib and libbz2:

= Getting zlib and bzlib2 =
Download the source distributions of zlib and bzip2:
  * zlib: http://www.zlib.net/
  * libbz2: http://www.bzip.org/
Extract the files somewhere sensible; I put them in c:/boost

= Building the boost libs =
`/c/boost/boost_1_38_0 >bjam --with-iostreams --with-thread --with-python -sZLIB_SOURCE=c:/boost/zlib-1.2.3 -sBZIP2_SOURCE=c:/boost/bzip2-1.0.5 install`
