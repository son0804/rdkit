#summary Overview of available functionality

= General Molecular Functionality =
 * Input/Output: SMILES, MDL Mol, SDF, TDT, RDKit binary format
 * “Cheminformatics”:
   * Substructure searching with SMARTS
   * Canonical SMILES
   * Chirality support
   * Easy serialization (molecule < - > text)
 * 2D depiction (including constrained depiction and 2D depiction of 3D structures)
 * 2D -> 3D conversion via distance geometry
 * UFF implementation for cleaning up geometries
 * Fingerprinting (Daylight-like, atom pairs, topological torsions, Morgan/circular, “MACCS keys”, etc.)
 * Similarity/diversity picking
 * Hierarchical Subgraph/Fragment analysis
 * Gasteiger-Marsili charges
 * Shape-based similarity
 * Molecule-molecule alignment
 * Molecular transformations (using SMARTS)
 * Chemical reactions
 * Hierarchical RECAP analysis
 * BRICS implementation for fragmenting and reassembling molecules
 * Shape-based molecular alignment (subshape algorithm)

= Molecular Machine Learning =
 * Molecular descriptor library:
   * Topological (kappa3, Balaban J, etc.)
   * Electrotopological state (EState)
   * clogP, MR (Wildman and Crippen approach)
   * "MOE like" VSA descriptors
   * Atom pairs and topological torsions
   * others
 * Learning:
   * Clustering
   * Decision trees
   * Functional, but not particularly polished implementations of naïve Bayes and kNN
   * Bagging, random forests
 * Infrastructure:
   * data splitting
   * shuffling
   * out-of-bag classification
   * models and descriptor calculators are serializable
