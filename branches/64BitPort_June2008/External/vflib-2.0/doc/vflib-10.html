<H2>3.5 Adding and using node/edge attributes</H2>

<P>Semantic attributes are handled by the Graph class through
<CODE>void *</CODE> pointers, and so any built-in or user defined type
can be used for node or edge attributes. 
<P>The use of pointers has the advantage of making possible to
manage the attributes efficiently, avoiding unnecessary copies,
and allowing different graphs to share the memory areas used for
the attributes. On the other hand, especially in a language like C++ that
does not support automatic garbage collection, there is the problem
of the ownership of the pointed data structure: who is responsible
for allocating the attribute, for cloning it (i.e.
allocating a new copy of it) when necessary, and for
deallocating it?
<P>The easiest answer for the user would be: the Graph class. But this choice
would have implied excessive limitations to the flexibility of the
attribute management. 
<P>For example, in many situations it would be reasonable
to have the attributes dynamically allocated on the heap, with
a separated attribute instance for each node/edge. However there are
cases where only a very limited set of attribute values are possible,
and so a great memory saving can be obtained by preallocating these values
(possibly with static allocation) and sharing the pointers among all
the nodes/edges of the graphs. Giving the Graph class the responsibility for
the allocation/deallocation of the attributes would imply that only one
allocation policy must be chosen, at the price of an efficiency loss in the
cases where this policy is not the best one.
<P>So, the rules we have followed in the design of the library are:
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>ARGLoader</CODE> objects are responsible for allocating the 
attributes when the graph data is generated or read; the user that
writes his/her own <CODE>ARGLoader</CODE> is the most indicated person to
decide which allocation policy is the best. <CODE>ARGLoader</CODE> objects
should not be concerned with attribute clonation or deallocation; they
simply pass the pointers to the <CODE>Graph</CODE> object that is built.
Note that the <CODE>ARGEdit</CODE> class does not perform attribute allocation;
it simply receives the attribute pointers from the caller.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>Graph</CODE> objects by default do not deal with attribute
allocation, clonation or deallocation. However, it is possible to 
register a node deallocation function and an edge deallocation
function within each graph.</LI>
<LI> Everything else is upon the shoulders of the library user, which has
to understand when an attribute must be cloned or deallocated, and
to perform these operations iterating over the nodes and the edges.
In particular, notice that when multiple graphs are built using the
same <CODE>ARGLoader</CODE>, it is usually necessary to clone the node/edge
attributes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In order to avoid the need of pointer casting when dealing with
attributes, the library provide a template class <CODE>ARGraph&lt;N,E></CODE>,
derived from <CODE>Graph</CODE>, for graphs with node attributes of type
<CODE>N</CODE> and edge attributes of type <CODE>E</CODE>.
<P>How are attributes employed in the matching process? The user can
provide an object of the graph class with a <EM>node compatibility
function</EM> and an <EM>edge compatibility function</EM>. These are functions
taking two attribute pointers, and returning a <CODE>bool</CODE> value that
is <CODE>false</CODE> if the corresponding nodes or edges are to be 
considered incompatible and must not be paired in the matching process.
In this way, the search space can be profitably pruned removing 
semantically undesirable matchings. 
Notice that the matching algorithm uses the compatibility functions
of the first of the two graphs used to construct the initial state.
<P>Now let us turn to a practical example. Suppose that our nodes
must represent points in a plane; we will associate with each node
an attribute holding its cartesian coordinates. For simplicity,
the edges will have no attributes. Suppose we have
a class <CODE>Point</CODE> to represent the node attributes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>

class Point
  { public:
      float x, y;
      Point(float x, float y)
        { this->x=x;
          this->y=y;
        }
  };
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now, if we want to allocate the attributes on heap, we need 
a deallocation function:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
void deallocate_point(Point *p)
  { delete p;
  }
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We will also need a compatibility function for the matching process.
Suppose that we consider two points to be compatible if their euclidean
distance is less than a threshold, say 0.1:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#define MAXDIST 0.1

bool point_compat(Point *a, Point *b)
  { double dist = hypot(a->x - b->x, a->y - b->y);
         // Function hypot is declared in &lt;math.h>

    return dist &lt; MAXDIST;
  }
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We can build two graphs with these attributes using the <CODE>ARGEdit</CODE> class:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
int main()
  { ARGEdit ed1, ed2;

    ed1.InsertNode( new Point(10.0, 7.5) );
    ed1.InsertNode( new Point(2.7, -1.9) );
    ed1.InsertEdge(1, 0, NULL);
    // ... and so on ...

    ARGraph&lt;Point, void> g1(&amp;ed1);
    ARGraph&lt;Point, void> g2(&amp;ed2);

    g1.SetNodeDestroy(deallocate_point);
    g2.SetNodeDestroy(deallocate_point);

    g1.SetNodeCompat(point_compat);

    VFSubState s0(&amp;g1, &amp;g2);

    // Now matching can begin...
