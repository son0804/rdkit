#summary Building the RDKit with anaconda

= Introduction =

Anaconda is nicely packaged, and commercially supported, scientific python distribution: http://continuum.io/downloads


= Details =

Start by installing anaconda.

You need to build boost and the RDKit using the anaconda configuration.

== Building Boost ==

In a shell where anaconda is active, go to the boost source directory and do:
{{{
./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=python,regex
./b2 -j4
}}}
Now copy the libraries and include files to your anaconda install dir (mine is `~/anaconda`):
{{{
cp stage/lib/*.so ~/anaconda/lib
cp -r boost ~/anaconda/include
}}}

== Building the RDKit ==

Go to the directory with the RDKit source and follow the usual procedure:
{{{
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/home/glandrum/anaconda/lib/python2.7/config/libpython2.7.a -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/glandrum/anaconda/include/python2.7 -DBOOST_ROOT=/home/glandrum/anaconda ..
make -j4 install
}}}
That's it. You can, of course, add whatever RDKit configuration options you prefer to the cmake line.

To use the new build, you will need to, as usual, add `$RDBASE/lib` to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and `$RDBASE` to PYTHONPATH.
