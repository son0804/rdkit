******  Release_XXX2007_1 *******
(Changes relative to Release_Aug2007_1)

Bug Fixes
 - the Recap code no longer generates illegal fragments for
   highly-branched atoms. (issue 1801871)
 - the Recap code no longer breaks cyclic bonds to N
   (issue 1804418)
 
New Features
 - The SparseIntVect class (used by the atom pairs and topological
   torsions) is now implemented in C++.
 - The package $RDKit/Python/Chem/MolDb has been added to help deal
   with molecular databases (this was intended for the August release
   and overlooked)
 - The module $RDKit/Python/Chem/FastSDMolSupplier has been added to
   provide a fast (at the expense of memory consumption) class for
   working with SD files.
 - A new directory $RDKit/Projects has been created to hold things
   that don't really fit in the existing directory structure.
 - The new project $RDKit/Projects/DbCLI has been added. This contains
   command-line scripts for populating molecular database and
   searching them using substructure or similarity.

Other
 - The full set of tests is now easier to setup and run on new
   machines. (issue 1757265) 


******  Release_Aug2007_1 *******
(Changes relative to Release_April2007_1)

Bug Fixes
 - operators and SparseIntVects. (issue 1716736)
 - the Mol file parser now calculates cis/trans labels for double
   bonds where the two ends had the same substituents. (issue 1718794)
 - iterator interface to DiscreteValueVects and UniformGrid3D. (issue
   1719831)
 - improper removal of stereochemistry from ring atoms (issue
   1719053)
 - stereochemistry specifications and ring bonds.  (issue 1725068)
 - handling of aromatic bonds in template molecules for chemical
   reactions. (issue 1748846)
 - handling of unrecognized atom types in the descriptor calculation
   code. (issue 1749494)
 - ChemicalReactionException now exposed to Python. (issue 1749513)
 - some small problems in topological torsions and atom pairs

New Features
 - The Atom Pairs and Topological Torsions code can now provide
   "explanations" of the codes. See $RDBASE/Python/Chem/AtomPairs for
   details.
 - The PointND class has been exposed to Python
 - The "Butina" clustering algorithm [JCICS 39:747-50 (1999)] is now
   available in $RDBase/Python/Ml/Cluster/Butina.py 
 - A preliminary implementation of the subshape alignment algorithm is
   available. 
 - The free version of MS Visual C++ is now supported.   
 - There is better support for queries in MDL mol files. (issue 1756962)
   Specifically: ring and chain bond queries; the not modifier for
   atom lists; R group labels. 
 - An EditableMol class is now exposed to Python to allow molecules to
   be easily edited. (issue 1764162)
 - The RingInfo class is now exposed to Python.
 - The replaceSidechains and and replaceCore functions have been added
   in the ChemTransforms library and are exposed to Python as
   Chem.ReplaceSidechains and Chem.ReplaceCore.
 - pickle support added to classes: PointND
 - atoms and bonds now support the HasQuery() and GetSmarts() methods
   from Python.   
   
Other
 - Similarity scores can now be calculated from Python in bulk
   (i.e. calculating the similarity between one vector and a list of
   others). This can be substantially faster than calling the
   individual routines multiple times. The relevant functions are
   BulkTanimotoSimilarity, BulkDiceSimilarity, etc.
 - The calculation of AtomPairs and TopologicalTorsions fingerprints
   is now a lot more efficient.
 - Optimization of the Dice metric implementation for SparseIntVects
 - The Visual Studio build files have been moved to the directories
   $RDBASE/Code/Build.VC71 and $RDBASE/Code/Build.VC80. This allows
   simultaneous support of both versions of the system and cleans up
   the source trees a bit.
 - Boost version 1.34 is now supported (testing has been done on 1.34 and 1.34.1).
 - Updates to the "Getting Started" documentation.
 
******  Release_April2007_1 *******
(Changes relative to Release_Jan2007_1)

Bug Fixes
 - handing of isotope information in SMILES has been fixed
 - "implicit" hydrogens are now added to charged atoms explicitly when
   writing SMILES. (issue 1670149)
 - the 2D->3D code no longer generates non-planar conjugated 4-rings
   (e.g. C1=CC=C1). (issue 1653802) 
 - removing explicit hydrogens no longer produces incorrect smiles 
   (issue 1694023)
 - bit indices and signature lengths in the AtomPairs code no longer
   being calculated incorrectly. *NOTE* this changes the bits that are
   set, so if you have existing signatures, they will need to be
   regenerated.
 - Fixed a bug causing MolSuppliers to generate incorrect length
   information when a combination of random access and iterator
   interfaces are used. (issue 1702647)
 - Fixed a bug leading to incorrect line numbers in error messages
   from the SDMolSuppler. (issue 1695221)

New Features
 - chemical reactions are now supported
 - there is a new entry point into the 2D depictor code,
   compute2DCoordsMimicDistMat(), that attempts to generate 2D
   depictions that are similar to the structure described by the
   distance matrix. There's also a shorthand approach for calling this
   to mimic a 3D structure available as:
   AllChem.GenerateDepictionMatching3DStructure()
 - DiscreteValueVect and UniformGrid3D now support the binary 
   operators |, &, +, and -.
 - a reader/writer for TPL files has been added.
 - support has been added for MolCatalogs: hierarchical catalogs that
   can store complete molecules.
 - the protrude distance metric for shapes has been added
 - pickle support added to classes: UniformGrid, DiscreteValueVect,
   Point 
 - added the class DataStructs/SparseIntVect to improve performance
   and clarity of the AtomPairs code

Other
 - the non-GUI code now supports python2.5; the GUI code may work with
   python2.5, but that has not been tested
 - the Mol and SD file parsers have been sped up quite a bit.
 - the "Crippen" descriptors are now calculated somewhat faster.
 - in-code documentation updates
 - new documentation for beginners in $RDBASE/Docs/Book

******  Release_Jan2007_1 *******
(Changes relative to Release_Oct2006_1)

Bug Fixes
  - zero-atom molecules now trigger an exception
  - dummy atoms are no longer labelled 'Xe'
  - core leak in the mol file writer fixed
  - mol files with multiple charge lines are now correctly parsed
  - a workaround was installed to prevent crashes in the regression
    tests on Windows when using the newest VC++ v7 series compiler.
    (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1607290&group_id=160139&atid=814650)
  - chirality perception (which requires partial sanitization) is no
    longer done by the MolFileParser when sanitization is switched
    off.
  - Two potential memory corruption problems were fixed (rev's 150 and
    151).

New Features
  - optional use of chirality in substructure searches
  - MolWriters can now all take a stream as an argument
  - Chiral terms can now be included in the DistanceGeometry
    embedding.

Other
  - $RDBASE/Code/Demos/RDKit/BinaryIO is a demonstration of using
    boost IOStreams and the ROMol pickling mechanism to generate
    highly compressed, random-access files of molecules.
  - the Point code has been refactored
