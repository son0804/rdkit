= Requirements =

Compatibility: PostgreSQL 8.4+

You need a source distribution of PostgreSQL to be able to build the cartridge.

= Compilation and Testing = 

The Makefile assumes that the RDKit is installed in $RDBASE. You will need $RDBASE/bin in your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Copy the cartridge directory ($RDBASE/Code/PgSQL/rdkit) to the postgresql contrib directory
 
{{{
 cd rdkit
 make && make install && make installcheck 
}}}

The last step will take a few minutes.


= Adding the cartridge to a database =

Install rdkit cartridge into the database DB: 
   `psql DB < rdkit.sql`

Uninstall rdkit from database DB:
   `psql DB < uninstall_rdkit.sql`
