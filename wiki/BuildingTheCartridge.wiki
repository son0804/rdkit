#summary How to build the PostgreSQL cartridge

= Requirements =

Compatibility: PostgreSQL 8.4+

At the moment the cartridge Makefiles need to be located in the PostgreSQL source tree, so uou need a source distribution of PostgreSQL to be able to build the cartridge. This means that using your linux distributions package manager to install PostgreSQL probably will not work. 

Until the cartridge code is included in an RDKit release (Q3 2010), you also need to build the RDKit from subversion; earlier releases will not work.

= Compilation and Testing = 

The Makefile assumes that the RDKit is installed in $RDBASE. You will need $RDBASE/bin in your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Copy the cartridge directory ($RDBASE/Code/PgSQL/rdkit) to the postgresql contrib directory
 
{{{
 cd rdkit
 make && make install && make installcheck 
}}}

The last step will take a few minutes.


= Adding the cartridge to a database =

Install rdkit cartridge into the database DB: 
   `psql DB < rdkit.sql`

Uninstall rdkit from database DB:
   `psql DB < uninstall_rdkit.sql`
