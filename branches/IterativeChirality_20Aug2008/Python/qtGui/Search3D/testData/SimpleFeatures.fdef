# aromatic rings of various sizes:
#
# Note that with the aromatics, it's important to include the ring-size queries (;rN) along with
# the aromaticity query for two reasons:
#   1) Much of the current feature-location code assumes that the feature point is 
#      equidistant from the atoms defining it. Larger definitions like: a1aaaaaaaa1 will actually 
#      match things like 'o1c2cccc2ccc1', which have an aromatic unit spread across multiple simple
#      rings and so don't fit that requirement.
#   2) It's *way* faster.
