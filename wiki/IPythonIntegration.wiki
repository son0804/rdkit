#summary Integration into the IPython console

As of v0.11 [http://www.ipython.org IPython] added an extremely cool [http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-0.11/whatsnew/version0.11.html#qtconsole-011 qt-based console].

In addition to the great ipython integration (see the link above), you get syntax highlighting and graphical calltips in the console:

It's also quite easy to add support for graphical display of objects to IPython. This is now supported in the RDKit (in svn as of 29 October 2011, will be in the 2011.12 release) via the module `rdkit.Chem.Draw.IPythonConsole`. Once you import this module, RDKit molecules will be displayed graphically in the console:

The drawings can be a bit small for larger molecules:

But it's easy to increase the size:

Another nice feature is that the results of `GetSubstructMatch()` and `GetSubstructMatches()` are highlighted:

If you want to go back to text display of molecules, use the function `IPythonConsole.UninstallIPythonRenderer()`:
