== Simplify Installation ==

Notes from the ideatorrent site;
  * Make installation as simple as possible. 
  * Get rid of as many external dependencies as humanly possible. 
  * Get rid of environment variables that have to be manually set up. 
  * Separate code, compilation folder and installation folder - those should be three different locations. 

  * Create and publish binary packages - rpm, deb etc. for all major OSes 
(Linux/OSX/Windows).
