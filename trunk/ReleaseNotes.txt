******  Release_April2007_1 *******
(Changes relative to Release_Jan2007_1)

Bug Fixes
 - handing of isotope information in SMILES has been fixed
 - "implicit" hydrogens are now added to charged atoms explicitly when
   writing SMILES
 - the non-GUI code now supports python2.5; the GUI code may work with
   python2.5, but that has not been tested
 - the 2D->3D code no longer generates non-planar conjugated 4-rings
   (e.g. C1=CC=C1) 


New Features
 - chemical reactions are now supported
 - there is a new entry point into the 2D depictor code,
   compute2DCoordsMimicDistMat(), that attempts to generate 2D
   depictions that are similar to the structure described by the
   distance matrix.
 - DiscreteValueVect now supports the binary operators |, &, +, and -.
 - a reader/writer for TPL files has been added.
 - support has been added for MolCatalogs: hierarchical catalogs that
   can store complete molecules.
 - the protrude distance metric for shapes has been added
 - pickle support added to classes: UniformGrid, DiscreteValueVect,
   Point 

Other
 - the Mol and SD file parsers have been sped up quite a bit.


******  Release_Jan2007_1 *******
(Changes relative to Release_Oct2006_1)

Bug Fixes
  - zero-atom molecules now trigger an exception
  - dummy atoms are no longer labelled 'Xe'
  - core leak in the mol file writer fixed
  - mol files with multiple charge lines are now correctly parsed
  - a workaround was installed to prevent crashes in the regression
    tests on Windows when using the newest VC++ v7 series compiler.
    (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1607290&group_id=160139&atid=814650)
  - chirality perception (which requires partial sanitization) is no
    longer done by the MolFileParser when sanitization is switched
    off.
  - Two potential memory corruption problems were fixed (rev's 150 and
    151).

New Features
  - optional use of chirality in substructure searches
  - MolWriters can now all take a stream as an argument
  - Chiral terms can now be included in the DistanceGeometry
    embedding.

Other
  - $RDBASE/Code/Demos/RDKit/BinaryIO is a demonstration of using
    boost IOStreams and the ROMol pickling mechanism to generate
    highly compressed, random-access files of molecules.
  - the Point code has been refactored
