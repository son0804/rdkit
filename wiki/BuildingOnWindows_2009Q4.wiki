#summary New windows build instructions
#labels Development,Notes

The instructions below are for versions of the code starting Q4 2009.

== Getting Ready ==


== Installing Boost ==


== Building the Code ==
  * follow the Installing Boost instructions above.
  * environment variables:
    * RDBASE: the root directory of the RDKit distribution (e.g. ~/RDKit)
    * PATH: make sure it includes $RDBASE/bin and wherever the boost shared libraries were installed
    * The following are required if you are planning on using the Python wrappers:
      * PYTHONPATH: make sure it includes $RDBASE
    * if you built your own version of boost and cmake complains about not being able to find it, define the environment variable BOOST_ROOT to point to the directory containing the boost source.
  * Building: 

== Testing the Build (optional, but recommended) ==
  * create the databases used by the Python tests, requires sqlite3 to be installed:
    * `sqlite3 $RDBASE/Data/RDTests.sqlt < $RDBASE/rdkit/Dbase/test_data/RDTests.sqlite`
    * `sqlite3 $RDBASE/Data/RDData.sqlt < $RDBASE/rdkit/Dbase/test_data/RDData.sqlite`
  * cd to $RDBASE/build and do `ctest`
  * you're done!
