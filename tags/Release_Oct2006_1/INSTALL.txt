Unfortunately there's not a lot of install documentation. Take a look
in:
 - $RDBASE/Docs/SoftwareRequirements.sh
 - $RDBASE/Scripts/NightlyBuildAndTest.sh
to see some info about additional requirements and how to get things
built.

In brief, once you have all the requirements installed, and the
environment variables set, you should be able to do:
1) cd $RDBASE/External
2) make
3) cd $RDBASE/Code
4) make all
5) make regrs

If you encounter problems, please ask on the mailing list
(http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=48674) so that
we can try and get this documentation in better shape.
