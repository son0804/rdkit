#summary Loading molecules more quickly

_in progress_

= Introduction =

By default the RDKit does a lot of work when constructing molecules. The work includes ring-finding, perception of chemistry, and correction of stereochemistry.
 
== The Sanitization Process ==

  # m.ClearComputedProps()
  # Chem.Cleanup(m)
  # m.UpdatePropertyCache()
  # Chem.Kekulize(m)  <- includes GetSymmSSSR()
  # Chem.AssignRadicals(m)
  # Chem.SetAromaticity(m)
  # Chem.SetConjugation(m)
  # Chem.AssignStereochemistry(m,True)
  # Chem.AdjustHs(m)   <- only available from python in 2011_12 release and later


== Timing ==

  * Dataset: 100000 molecules from ChEMBL
  * Code version: SVN, streambuf branch, 21 Nov 2011
  * Host: gulo_linux: Intel i7 870 (2.93 GHz), Ubuntu 10.10 x64, g++ 4.4.4
