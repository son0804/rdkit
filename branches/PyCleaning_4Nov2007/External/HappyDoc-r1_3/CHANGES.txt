HappyDoc Change History

  Version 1.3 -- 

      - Fixed problem with relative URL references in HTML output.

  Version 1.1 -- 

      - Enhanced boolean command line switch handling to support
        values like 'yes', 'no', 'on', 'off', 'true', and 'false'.

      - Added an initial DocBook formatter implementation from Balazs
        Scheidler <bazsi@balabit.hu>.

  Version 1.0 -- 

      - This version was not actually released.

      - Per-directory README.txt detection.  (Useful for Zope
        products and Python packages.)

      - Support LICENSE.txt, CHANGES.txt, ANNOUNCE.txt and other
        StructuredText files referenced from README.txt.  Support
        external files which do not have .txt extension.

      - Now installs using distutils.

      - Include code related to Patch 103054 to fix problems with
        tables in HTML and to make the HTML output smaller by reducing
        extra whitespace.

      - Cleaned up some progress reporting output.

      - Added option to docset to set a prefix to every file or
        directory created as output.  This is important for creating
        output with safe names in case module names end up being
        parsed to something which does not make a valid filename.  It
        can also be useful when storing output in a web application
        server such as Zope, where some names might be reserved.

      - Added docset and formatter parmeter info to the output.

      - Formatter option to disable html quoting of docstring text.


  Version 0.9.3 -- 

      - Fixed the single file docset so that HTML and text mode works.

  Version 0.9.2 -- 

      - Fixed a problem with the 'import' statement handler.  Also
        changed HTML formatter output for 'import' statements to include
        keywords in bold.

  Version 0.9.1 -- 

      - Minor packaging changes.

  Version 0.9 -- 

      - **Patch 101758** - (From mikem42) Added a new command line
        argument '--no_comments' to tell the parser to ignore comments
        when looking for documentation text.

      - **Patch 103017** - (From hooft) Fixed '--no_private_names'
        so that names beginning with two '_' are displayed even when
        private names are not.

      - **Bug126855** - (From hooft) Improvements to expression
        handling for argument defaults.

      - **Bug126187** - (From hooft) Fixed up the way import
        statements are handled so that information is not lost.

      - **Bug114517** - Corrected a problem with extracting the one
        line summary of some doc strings.

      - Renamed the 'formatter' directory and contents to avoid
        clashing with the standard Python module formatter.py.

      - Now supports installation via disutils.

  Version 0.8 -- 

      - **Patch 101602** - Closing class output files in multi-file
        docsets.  This should remove the "too many open files" errors
        that several users reported on some platforms.

      - Passing "'-'" to the '-p' option now disables the package
        description file handling.

      - Updated the location of the source documentation files on
        Zope.org.

      - **Bug115451** fixed so that only the correct comments are
        output.

      - Added new option --no_private_names which hides names
        beginning with '_', thus resolving feature request 114877.

      - **Bug114872** fixed so that using 'raise' with no arguments
        is ignored.

  Version 0.7.1 -- 

      - **Fix 113738** - Keeping up with all of the open file handles in
        order to know the relative path to the "first" root file
        causes some systems to run out of open file handles.  This
        change fixes the problem by only remembering the first file
        opened.

  Version 0.7 -- 

      - **Fix** formatter or docset getting unrecognized named parameters.

      - **Fix** change detection with regression tests.

      - Moved the test code into a special subdirectory to clean up the
        root area of the app.

      - **Fix** 'mkdir()' method of 'HappyDoc' to support win32
        systems.  The fix is based on a patch submitted by Jesper
        Hertel <JH@CDDK.DK>.

      - **Fix** Bug Reported by Jesper Hertel: Default arguments of
        negative numbers break.

         For example::

            def func(x=-1):
                pass

      - **Fix 113954** HTML encode function parameter values (and all
        'writeCode' content for HTML formatter).

      - Changed exception list in HTML formatter so that it is output
        as code.

      - Added some new methods to the text formatter to support
        changes in how the exception list is now written.

  Version 0.6 -- First public release

    - Added regression test checks to Makefile.  This makes it easy to
      run a complete regression test and verify that the results are
      correct.

    - Added checking of actual output files, not just stdout, to
      regression test rules in Makefile.

    - Changed HTMLTable formatter so that it accepts an argument to
      disable the timestamp feature.  This is mostly useful for the
      regression testing, but might also be desirable for some output
      circumstances.  The default is to leave the feature enabled.

    - Changed test framework to allow an output directory to be
      specified on the command line.

    - Changed test framework to make creation of tests easier to
      scale.

    - Verified support passing arguments to formatters from the
      command line.

  Version 0.5 -- Moved code to SourceForge.

    - Minor changes to functionality

    - Rearranged Makefile and some other files to make them
      SourceForge-friendly.

  Version 0.4 -- Import, testing, and formatter changes.

    - Handles imported names in the 'from X import Y' style import
    statements.  Makes them links where possible.  

    - Improved unit test framework (requires
    "PyUnit":http://pyunit.sourceforge.net ).

    - Fixed some problems with the formatter_textfile.py module which
    caused it to generate spurrious content.

  Version 0.3 -- Allow lists to have multiple columns.

  Version 0.2.1 -- Fixed a problem with references between modules and
  back to the root level toc file in the HTML Table formatter.  Also
  changed happydoc.py to use the CVS variable 'Name' to determine its
  version.

  Version 0.2 -- Created dynamic plugin loader class to manage docset
  and formatter pluggins.  See pluginloader.py.

  Version 0.1.1 -- Minor improvements on 0.1, mostly in the
  'htmltable' formatter.

  Version 0.1 -- Initial private release given to a few people to beta
  test.
