#summary Building the Jan2008 release of the RDKit under windows.
#labels Deprecated

The instructions below are for the source distributions from Jan2008.

== Installing Boost ==
 * download the boost source distribution from [http://www.boost.org the boost web site]
 * extract the source to a '''non-temporary''' location on your machine, you're going to need it to build the RDKit as well as boost. (e.g. c:/boost/boost_1_34_1)
 * [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=60825b0f0612142119k383e61bah54c85e8ff60fca80%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=rdkit-devel Make a modification to the boost::random source] _Note: no longer necessary in the subversion version_
 * Copy the boost::logging stuff into the boost source tree: _Note: no longer necessary in the subversion version_
   ** copy the directory $RDBASE/External/boost_logging/boost/log to $BOOST/boost 
   ** copy the directory $RDBASE/External/boost_logging/libs/log to BOOST/libs
 *  Read section 5.2 of the  [http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/windows.html#prepare-to-use-a-boost-library-binary  Boost.Build documentation for windows]

== Building the C++ Components ==
 * follow the Installing Boost instructions above.
 * environment variables:
   ** RDBASE: the root directory of the RDKit distribution (e.g. c:/glandrum/RDKit)
   ** BOOSTHOME: should be wherever you extracted the boost source (e.g. c:/boost/boost_1_34_1)
   ** BOOST_BUILD_PATH: should be the same as $BOOSTHOME
   ** PYTHON_ROOT: wherever python is installed (e.g. /usr)
   ** PYTHON_VERSION: the first two digits of the python version (e.g. 2.5, '''not''' 2.5.1)
   ** PYTHONPATH: make sure it includes $RDBASE/Python

*NOTE:* PATH needs to include $RDBASE/bin. If you're using cygwin, be sure to use the /c form of the path (not c:/). So if $RDBASE is c:/glandrum/RDKit, then /c/glandrum/RDKit/bin should be in the PATH.

 * Building: cd to $RDBASE/Code and do "bjam" (this builds all libraries, wrappers, and regression tests)

== Testing the Build (optional, but recommended) ==
 * cd to $RDBASE/Code and do `python $RDBASE/Python/TestRunner.py test_list.py`
 * cd to $RDBASE/Code/GraphMol and do `python $RDBASE/Python/TestRunner.py test_list.py`
