<p><b>Thread-safety</b></p>
<p>The Boost Log library is thread-safe, while being efficient.</p>
<p>(As a side-note, <a href="predefined.html#log">ts_appender</a> is a very useful 
  Appender function).</p>
<p><a href="logs.html#behavior">Manipulating logs' behavior</a> (doing any of: 
  adding a Appender, or a Modifier or enabling/disabling logs), is thread-safe. 
</p>
<p>Whenever writing to a log, the first thing I will do is &quot;ask if the message 
  should be written to the log&quot; (based on the log's <a href="manipulating_logs.html#level">level</a> 
  and message's <a href="manipulating_logs.html#level">level</a>). </p>
<pre class="code">
BOOST_LOG(app) << whatever << you << want << to << write;
// OR
BOOST_LOGL(app,lvl) << whatever << you << want << to << write;

// equivalent to (pseudo-code):
// if ( can_write_message(app,lvl) ) app << whatever <<....;
</pre>
<p>If <i>can_write_message </i>returns true, the writing will take place (that 
  is, whatever follows BOOST_LOG[L](..) gets executed). Otherwise, processing 
  stops, thus whatever follows BOOST_LOG[L](...) does not get executed.</p>
<p>The <b>can_write_message(...)</b> test does not incur in a (mutex) lock (it 
  would be too inefficient). Thus, once a thread enables/disables some log(s), 
  it will take a short while for this to propagate to the other threads. This 
  is not so bad, compared to the gains in efficiency.</p>
<p>In order for the changes to propagate <i>instantly</i>, you're encouraged to 
  enable/disable logs at the beginning of the program (when only one thread is 
  running). </p>
<p>Of course, you can - at any time -, enable/disable logs, as your application 
  is running. It could prove very useful if you have a server application, a lot 
  of active users, and - while running - you might want to enable additional logging.</p>
