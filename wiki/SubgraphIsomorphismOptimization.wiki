#summary Improving the speed of subgraph isomorphism and replacing the vflib dependency
#labels Notes,Development

= Goals =

  # Improve speed
  # Remove vflib dependency: vflib is nice to use, but it's a PITA (and performance problem) to have to translate back and forth between the graph representations.
  # Lay the groundwork for related algorithms (i.e. MCS)

= Method =

There's a BGL-based implementation of the Ullmann algorithm in the CDL: http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdelib, take that as a starting point and see what happens.

Put everything off on its own branch:
http://rdkit.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rdkit/branches/Ullmann_9Feb2009/

Some fairly substantial changes to the ullmann.h header were required. The mods were sent back to Vladimir Sykora and checked in to the RDKit repository.

= Results =

== Accuracy ==

This is the alpha and omega.

Regression test based on the Lewis SMARTS patterns and 1000 pubchem compounds set up in $RDBASE/Data/SmartsLib/tests.


As of initial commit (rev993), these tests pass.

== Performance ==

Numbers here are to run the regression test mentioned above.

  # VFLib, algorithm VF2 : 45 seconds
  # VFLib, Ullmann algorithm : 56 seconds
  # ullmann.h, rev993 : 34 seconds
  # ullmann.h, + degree pruning, rev994: 28 seconds
