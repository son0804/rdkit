= Introduction =

The goal here is to track the evolution of the performance of the RDKit over time.

The test data and scripts will be in svn.

= Details =

  # t1: construct 1000 molecules from smiles
  # t2: construct 1000 molecules from sdf
  # t3: construct 1823 fragment molecules from SMARTS (smiles really)
  # t4: 1000 x 100 HasSubstructMatch (100 from t3)
  # t5: 1000 x 100 GetSubstructMatches (100 from t3)
  # t6: construct 428 queries from RLewis_smarts.txt
  # t7: 1000 x 428 HasSubstructMatch
  # t8: 1000 x 428 GetSubstructMatches
  # t9: Generate canonical SMILES for 1000 molecules
  # t10: Generate mol blocks for 1000 molecules
  # t11: RECAP decomposition of the 1000 molecules
