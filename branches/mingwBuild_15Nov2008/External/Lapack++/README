       LAPACK++ v. 1.1a

LAPACK++ is a library for high performance linear algebra computations.
This version includes support for solving linear systems using LU, Cholesky,
QR matrix factorizations, and symmetric eigenvalue problems.

For documentation see the LAPACK++ User's Manual and Class Reference Manual, 
all available from netlib.

Lapack++ is no longer actively supported. The successor to this
project is that Template Numerical Toolkit (TNT), see 
http://math.nist.gov/tnt for details.

LAPACK++ v. 1.1 can use either the C-LAPACK library (also available from 
netlib) or the original Fortran LAPACK.

LAPACK++ v. 1.1 supports various matrix classes for vectors, non-symmetric
matrices, symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, symmetric matrices, 
banded, triangular, and tridiagonal matrices;   however,  Version 1.1 does 
not include all of the capabilities of original f77 LAPACK.  Emphasis is 
given to routines for solving linear systems consisting of non-symmetric 
matrices, symmetric positive definite systems, and solving linear least-
square systems.
