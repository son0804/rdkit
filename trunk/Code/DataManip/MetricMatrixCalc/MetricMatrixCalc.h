     *           In several cases this argument is irrelvant since vectType probably supports

     *  distMat - pointer to an array to write the distance matrix to
     *            it is assumed that the right sized array has already be allocated.
     *
     * FIX: we can probably make this function create the correct sized distMat and return
     * it to the caller, but when pushing he result out to a python array not sure how to
     * avoid copy the entire distance matrix in that case
     *
     * RETURNS:
     * 
     *  pointer to a 1D array of doubles. Only the lower triangle elements are
     *  included in the array
