#summary Ideas for GSOC 2013 projects
#labels Notes

==C++==
  * Erg fingerprints (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci050457y)
  * Unique ring families (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci200629w)
  * Fixing the bit assignment in the rdkit and layered fingerprints (canonical subgraph traversal)
  * Canonical graph traversal code
  * Tautomer enumeration and canonicalization
  * Canonical Kekule form
  * Add a new force field (MMFF?)
  * Improved molecule drawing code
  * Port MCS code -> Python

==Python==
  

==KNIME==


==Cartridge==
  * Similarity search performance: 
    * Revisit cartridge fingerprint index for efficiency
    * Cartridge optimization to use words instead of bytes for similarity
    * Improved similarity calculation for sparse FPs.
  * Reaction support in the cartridge


==Integration==
  * Pypi integration 
  * Code to automatically generate docs in the SWIG wrappers
  * Javascript canvas renderer implementation. Ideally with atom selection
  * rdkit type support in psycopg2
  * rdkit type support in pandas
  * rdkit type support in SQLAlchemy (building on Riccardo's work)
