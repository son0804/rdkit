<h1>SVDLIBC</h1>
<h3>Doug Rohde's SVD C Library</h3>
<h3>version 1.0</h3>
</center>
<hr>

SVDLIBC is a C library that is based on the <a
href="http://www.netlib.org/svdpack/">SVDPACKC library</a>, written by Michael
Berry, Theresa Do, Gavin O'Brien, Vijay Krishna and Sowmini Varadhan.  SVDLIBC
offers a cleaned-up version of the code with a sane library interface and a
front-end executable that performs matrix file type conversions, along with
computing the SVD.  Currently the only SVDPACKC algorithm implemented is
<b>las2</b>, because it seems to be consistently the fastest.  If there is a
demand, I could include other algorithms in the future.
<p>

<h3>Installing</h3>

To install SVDLIBC:

<ol>
<li><a href="svdlibc.tgz">Click here to download the tar file.</a>
<li>To unpack the tar file run this on the command-line:<br>
<b>tar xvzf svdlibc.tgz<br>
cd SVDLIBC</b>
<li>You may want to edit the Makefile to use your favorite compiler.
<li>Run <b>make</b>.
</ol>

This will build the <b>libsvd.a</b> library, located in a directory whose name
is based on your HOSTTYPE environment variable (note that some shells don't
have that set properly by default).  This allows compilation for different
architectures on a shared file system.  It will also create the command-line
interface executable, called <b>svd</b>.

<h3>Command-line Interface</h3>

The command-line interface, <b>svd</b>, allows you to perform an SVD on a
matrix, optionally storing the left- and right-singular vectors and the
singular values in separate files.  You can also use it to convert from one
matrix file format to another.
<p>
Note that the SVDPACKC matrix file formats are designed to be simple and do
not include magic cookies to allow the format to be automatically determined.
Therefore, you may need to use the -r and -w options to specify the input and
output formats.

<tr><th colspan=3>Usage
<tr><td colspan=3>svd [options] matrix_file

<tr><td>-a<td><i>algorithm</i>
<td>Set the algorithm to use.  They include:<br>
<table>
<tr><td width=30>las2<td>Single-Vector Lanczos Method (default)
</table>

<tr><td>-c<td><i>infile outfile</i>
<td>Converts a matrix file to a new format (using -r and -w to specify the old
and new formats).  Then exits immediately.

<tr><td>-d<td><i>dimensions</i>
<td>Desired number of SVD triples or dimensions (default is all)

<tr><td>-e<td><i>bound</i>
<td>Minimum magnitude of wanted eigenvalues for las2 (1e-30)

<tr><td>-k<td><i>kappa</i>
<td>Accuracy parameter for las2 (1e-6)

<tr><td>-i<td><i>iterations</i>
<td>Algorithm settling iterations (the default is hopefully a reasonable value)

<tr><td>-o<td><i>file_root</i>
<td>Root of files in which to store resulting U', S, and V'

<tr><td>-r<td><i>format</i>
<td>Input matrix file format (see below for <a href="#formats">format specifications</a>)<br>
<table>
<tr><td width=30>       st     <td>   Sparse text (default)
<tr><td>       sth    <td>   SVDPACK Harwell-Boeing text format
<tr><td>       dt     <td>   Dense text
<tr><td>       sb     <td>   Sparse binary
<tr><td>       db     <td>   Dense binary
</table>

<tr><td>-v<td><i>verbosity</i>
<td> Default is 1.  Use 0 for no feedback, 2 for more.

<tr><td>-w<td><i>format</i>
<td> Output matrix file format.  Options are same as for -r, but default is
dense text.<br>
</table>

<p>
If the -o option is used, the resulting U' and V' matrices will be stored in
files whose name is the specified file_root with "-Ut" or "-Vt" appended to
the end.  The matrices stored in these files are actually the transforms of
the traditionally defined U and V matrices, so that the rows of the "-Ut"
matrix are the left singular vectors and the rows of the "-Vt" matrix are the
right singular vectors, which is generally more convenient.  The "-S" file
contains an array of the singular values, the first line of which holds the
number of values.


<h3>C Library Interface</h3>

The interface to the SVDLIBC library is defined in <a
href="svdlib.h">svdlib.h</a>, which should be fairly self-explanatory.
<p>
The library defines three structures.  An <tt>SMat</tt> is a pointer to a
<tt>struct smat</tt>, which is a sparse matrix.  A <tt>DMat</tt> is a pointer
to a <tt>struct dmat</tt>, which holds a dense matrix.  Finally, a
<tt>SVDRec</tt> is a pointer to a <tt>struct svdrec</tt>, which holds the
results of an SVD: the dimensionality (d), the left- and right- singular
matrices (Ut and Vt), and >file types</a> (such as SVD_F_ST).
Any file type can be loaded to or written from either a sparse or dense
matrix.
<p>
Finally, the <tt>svdLAS2</tt> function actually computes the SVD.  It takes a
sparse matrix and some parameters and returns an SVDRec containing the
components of the SVD.


<h3>Matrix File Formats</h3>
<a name="formats">

The sparse formats are more efficient for sparse matrices, the dense ones for
dense matrices.  The binary formats will be faster to read and write and will
be smaller if the matrix uses high-precision floating point numbers.  Values
are stored in 4-byte floats, not in 8-byte doubles.
